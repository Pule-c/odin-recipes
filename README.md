This is my first project, itâ€™s time to put all of the HTML knowledge i have been acquiring so far into practice. 

The project is called RECIPES , its about different food recipes 

This was a fun little projectto build out a recipe website.
i learned alot about github and git as i commited often, usually
after a page was created and linked to the index.html file. I got 
yo practice how to write good commit comments, i feel they is alot to be desired
on that part .I will continue to improve as i practice more in the future.

I got to put in practice all that i have learned in foundations so far, like, links, images,
boilerplate, paragraphs, headings, unordered and ordered lists.
 
I am enjoying the journey and look forward of whats to come.
